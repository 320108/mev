All kubernetes definitions included in the source are aimed at development; in production internal services (anything other than the web application itself) should be changed from type 'NodePort' to 'ClusterIP'. The web application service should be exposed and the type set to 'LoadBalancer'

Rserve deployment definition calls for a single replica, which is to ease development, obviously the number of replicas should be at least 2 or higher to ensure a running worker up at all times. The number of simultaneously executing analyses **per running web application container** is governed by the number of threads in the ExecutorService bean as defined in edu.cccb.mev.context.Concurrency (number of available processors as of this writing.) Deployment elasticity should be handled through ```kubectl autoscale``` directives. Autoscaling the cluster should be handled by the cloud provider, not the application

Data retention in cluster environment is a complex problem so any data retention services such as database and ElasticSearch should ideally not be a part of kubernetes cluster and instead be provisioned by the cloud provider and the web application containers linked to these services. ElasticSearch is easily added via environment variables as above. Currently persistence.xml defines JPA for an H2 database which is what wildfly provides by default, as the code base was moving closer to production my plan was to add PostgreSQL (or whatever else is provided by AWS or Google) to the dev deployment, change the hibernate drivers to that and configure default datasource via wildfly configuration mechanisms - provide standalone.xml for the docker image and add <commands/> element to the maven plugin. There may be easier avenues
